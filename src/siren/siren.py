    """
    Interface for implementing a siren to be driven by the AF 11 timer.
    
    The AF timer implemented by this software has five buttons: Test,
    Alert, Fire, Attack, and Cancel.  Depending on the siren attached,
    some of these buttons may or may not have a function,  For example,
    if the timer is attached to a 2T22 siren, the "Fire" alert wouldn't
    have a function, as there are no solenoids on that siren.

    Each siren implementation is expected to derive from this class and
    implement whatever functionality makes sense.  The mode of operation
    of the siren can be customized as well.
    
    Note that each event function is called in a thread that can be
    cancelled.  To detect cancellation, use the `_wait_for_cancel` function.
